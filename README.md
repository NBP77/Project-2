# Tech-Blog

A tech blog website 

## Description

The main goal of this project was to create a tech blog for people to log in and create a user account 
 
A user can visit the website and create a username and password that saves to the database

Once the user creates an account or logs in you have the option to create a post or logout 

If stays on the page for too long the user is logged out

All of the user information is stored directly into mySQL
